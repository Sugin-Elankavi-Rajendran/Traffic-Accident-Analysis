# Traffic Accident Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis includes visualizing accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devansodariya/road-accident-united-kingdom-uk-dataset). Please download and place the dataset file (`your_dataset.csv`) in the project directory.

## Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

Run the analysis script:
```bash
python analysis_script.py
```
## Analysis Steps

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Explore accident severity distribution.
   - Analyze the temporal distribution of accidents (day of the week, month, time of day).

**2. Road Conditions and Weather Analysis**
   - Visualize accidents based on road surface conditions and weather.

**3. Geospatial Analysis**
   - Identify accident hotspots on a map.

**4. Contributing Factors Analysis**
   - Explore contributing factors such as junction control.

## Code Structure

- `analysis_script.py`: Python script containing the analysis code.
- `your_dataset.csv`: The dataset file.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to replace `your_dataset.csv` with the actual file name or path to your dataset in the script.
- Adjust parameters and code as needed based on your dataset and analysis goals.
